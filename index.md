## Welcome to MatchWorkshop...for your game!

MatchWorkshop is a society provide indie game developing opportunities.

It's fun to say Cross Platform .NET. But is it reasonable for someone to develop .NET without Visual Studio and Windows?

Is it fun to do .NET on a Mac in Sublime? Ubuntu and Emacs? Windows and Atom? You can use your editor PLUS get to use great features like Intellisense (not just Autocomplete), Add Reference, Format Document, and lots more. Develop anywhere, deploy anywhere (and to [Azure](http://www.azure.com)!)

![It's amazing! Really. Intellisense in YOUR editor.](images/sublimevisualstudio.jpg?raw=true)
